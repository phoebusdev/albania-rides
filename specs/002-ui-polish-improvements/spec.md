## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Stories

**New User Landing Experience**
As a first-time visitor to AlbaniaRides, I want to immediately understand what the platform offers and feel confident it's trustworthy, so I'm motivated to register and search for rides.

**Driver Browsing Experience**
As a passenger searching for rides, I want to quickly scan and compare available rides with clear visual hierarchy, so I can make informed booking decisions efficiently.

**Trust & Confidence Building**
As a user considering a cash-based ridesharing platform, I want to see clear trust signals (ratings, verification badges, safety information), so I feel comfortable booking rides.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new user lands on homepage, **When** they view the hero section, **Then** they see a visually appealing gradient with clear value proposition and prominent search form

2. **Given** a user is browsing available rides, **When** they view ride cards, **Then** they see clear visual hierarchy with driver ratings (stars), price (highlighted), and prominent booking CTA

3. **Given** a user hovers over interactive elements, **When** they move their cursor, **Then** they see smooth transitions and clear hover states indicating clickability

4. **Given** a user views their profile, **When** they look at their stats, **Then** they see clear visual separation with icons, colors, and badges indicating achievements

5. **Given** a user is on mobile, **When** they navigate the site, **Then** all touch targets are clearly visible, generously sized, and spacing prevents misclicks

6. **Given** a user completes an action, **When** the system provides feedback, **Then** they see animated confirmations (checkmarks, color changes) rather than plain text

### Edge Cases
- How do loading states appear? Skeleton loaders with smooth pulse animation
- What happens with empty results? Friendly empty state with icon and helpful CTA
- How does the site look on very large screens? Max-width containers with centered content
- What about keyboard navigation? Clear focus indicators on all interactive elements
- How are errors displayed? Colored alert boxes with icons and clear messaging
